About
======
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue Universityâ€™s Machine Intelligence and Networked Data Science Group (MINDS) 
Laboratory advised by [Prof. Abolfazl Hashemi](https://abolfazlh.github.io). My research focuses on trustworthy AI.

Previously, I have received my M.Sc. degree with a CGPA of **3.91/4.00** from the Department of Electrical and Electronics
Engineering, Bilkent University, under the supervision of [Prof. Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/). My research focused on 
modeling and prediction of time series under nonstationary environments. I have received my B.S. degree with **high honors** 
and graduated with a CGPA of **3.61/4.00** from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East 
Technical University, Turkey, in July 2021.

My research primarily centers on **deep learning and large-scale optimization**, with an emphasis on developing robust 
and privacy-preserving deep learning algorithms with mathematical guarantees. Recently, I have been particularly interested
understanding the learning dynamics of large-scale models, such as the memorization phenomenon, and study how these dynamics 
evolve under constraints like robustness and adversarial settings. I am also exploring the extension of these theoretical 
insights to practical domains, including distributed and federated learning.
