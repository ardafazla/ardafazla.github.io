About
======
I am currently an M.S. student with a CGPA of **3.91/4.00** at the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 
Bilkent University, under the supervision of [Prof. Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/). I have received 
my B.S. degree with **high honors** and graduated with a CGPA of **3.61/4.00** from the Department of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University, Turkey, in July 2021. 

Throughout my graduate research, **I have first-authored 4 journal papers (2 accepted, 2 submitted/in progress) in highly respected 
IEEE Transactions and Elsevier. I have also co-authored 2 journal papers and 1 conference paper, all in IEEE.**

My research primarily centers on **machine learning, deep learning, optimization and online learning**. Specifically, I am
interested in modeling and prediction of time series under adversarial and nonstationary environments. Recognizing that
real-world time series frequently exhibit complex patterns interchanging with time, I have developed context-aware
ensemble models by combining deep learning techniques with tree-based and statistical models. I have
mainly focused on joint optimization techniques, including combination of state-space models, constrained multi-objective optimization
through minimizing specific loss-functions, and joint training of multiple models by harnessing the power of correlation
via back-propagation. **My contributions have been acknowledged and published in highly respected journals, such as
IEEE Transactions and Elsevier.**
