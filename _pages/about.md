About
======
I am currently an M.S. student with a CGPA of *3.91/4.00* at the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, 
Bilkent University, under the supervision of [Prof. Suleyman S. Kozat](www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/). I have received 
my B.S. degree with *high honors* and graduated with a CGPA of *3.61/4.00* from the Department of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University, Turkey, in July 2021. 

Throughout my graduate research, *I have first-authored 4 journal papers (2 accepted, 2 submitted/in progress) in Elsevier
and highly respected IEEE Transactions. I have also co-authored 2 journal papers and 1 conference paper, all in IEEE.*

My research mainly focuses on *time series forecasting*, *machine learning*
and *optimization*. I specifically focus on time-series modeling and prediction under adversarial and nonstationary
environments. As real-life time series often contain irregular patterns interchanging with time, I have had success
with building context-aware models through combining multiple deep-learning, tree-based and statistical models.
Throughout my research, I have introduced novel ensemble models by utilizing different techniques, such as the 
joint optimization of state-space models, solving a weight optimization problem that minimizes a specific loss function, 
and jointly training multiple models by integrating correlation through back-propagation. *All of these works have been
recognized by highly respected journals (IEEE Transactions and Elsevier).*
