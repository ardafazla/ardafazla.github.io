### Image Captioning based on LSTM with Transfer Learning
_Neural Networks Course Project, 2022_  
* Constructed a framework, which generates meaningful sentences describing a given image (Image Captioning).  
* Employed state-of-the-art models such as ResNet, VGG-16 and InceptionV3, where LSTM is used as the main learning model for transfer learning.  
* Used BERT transformers for word embedding.  

### Surveillance â€“ Protective Measures  
_Middle East Technical University, Senior Year Project, 2021_  
* Designed a product that detects whether a person is not wearing a mask and/or showing fever symptoms.  
* Our mask detection system uses the YOLOv4 algorithm for classification, trained on a self-constructed dataset with image augmentation.
