### Hourly Wind Energy Prediction  
_Bilkent University, 2023_  
* Predicted the hourly energy data of multiple wind turbines in Turkey and Europe, showing chaotic and nonstationary behavior in multiple regions.  
* Developed a large-scale ML framework consisting of various adaptive feature construction and selection methods with models such as deep-learning (NN, ConvLSTM), machine learning (LightGBM, RandomForest), statistical (SARIMAX) models and state-of-the-art ensembling techniques. Increased the short-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art models by an average of *21\%* and long-term forecasting accuracy by an average of *8\%*.  

### Natural Gas Demand Prediction  
_Bilkent University, 2022_  
* Predicted the daily data of international natural gas demand in Turkey, which contains nonstationary multivariate time series from multiple sources.  
* Developed a large-scale ML framework specifically tailored towards a certain customer profile, where the predictions are obtained for the given data based on key indicators that are automatically extracted from the data itself and/or the user-given side information data. The constructed framework was deployed to various natural gas production companies.

### Small-Target Detection & Tracking  
_Middle East Technical University, 2021_  
* Developed an application in Python environment for real-time small target tracking by leveraging temporal data derived from the output of object detectors, with a superior performance over the widely-known YOLOv3 algorithm by *6\%*.  
* Constructed a novel multi-hypothesis tracking algorithm with an annotation tool for the semi-automatic correction of mislabeled UAV data. The deployed product decreased the total mislabeled data in various datasets by an average of *13\%*.
